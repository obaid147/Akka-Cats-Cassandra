PersistentBankAccount.scala

The Main BankAccount Actor will create persistent BankAccount Actor and after that it creates BankAccount,
It will send the CreateBankAccount Message which will initialize the state and whenever bank actor receives
some commands, those commands will reach back to me, So the bank actor will forward those to me so when i get an
BalanceUpdate i am going to reply back to bank. This was all in "COMMAND-HANDLER" for messages that this persistent
actor will receive.

"EVENT-HANDLER":- running 2 arg function (state and event)
